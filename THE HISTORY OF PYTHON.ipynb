    "The history of PYTHON emerged as a programming language that is known today, emerged in the late 80s, and early 90s by its, creatorGuido Van Rossum.\n",
    "It was developed in December 1989, who at that time was working at the CWI (a Dutch research center); he himself decided to start a project as a hobby to create an ABC programming language which was developed in the same research center ([Juan Pablo](https://platzi.com/blog/historia-python/), 2017)."

Van Rossum, on the other hand, the lead author of Python, continues to play a central role in the direction of the language in the Python community; he is known as a benevolent dictator for life.

As it is attractive to the field of Rapid Application Development **(RAD)**, it offers access to the dynamic writing opportunity and dynamic linking options.\n",
